Macha DA COSTA: Freelance in Mobile & Web development

## About Me
I'm freelance in Android development since 2014 june in Sophia Antipolis area and I develop android applications on smartphone since 2010.

My experience in Android development started with engineer internship realised at  [Prim'vision](https://www.primvision.com/) a start-up located at Villeneuve-Loubet. I had choose this internship to improve my mobile development in plus of web skill. For the little story : first the considered technology was Java For Mobile; at this time the green robot was under starlight and my superior change the specification application must be deployed on Android. Eclair version, the 2.1, just come out and I was really excited about this open source project, Android.

This experience with Android continued when I had the opportunity to give course at University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis. I am so enjoy to share my knowledge about my favourite language with student of [Licence Professionnelle de l'IUT Informatique](http://lpsil.unice.fr/doku.php).

After Eclair (2.1) comes Froyo (2.2), then between Gingerbread (2.3) and Kitkat (4.4) changes was not chill out, nevertheless, I always follow these patisseries.

Besides, I'm passionate about sports (running, volleyball, free diving), that is why the launch of first connected watch, in 2014 june, retain all my attention and feed my application project on heart rate monitoring.
