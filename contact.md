Macha DA COSTA: Freelance in Mobile & Web development at [ChillCoding](https://www.chillcoding.com)

## About Me
I'm Android developer since 2010 in the Sophia Antipolis area.

My experience in Android development started with an engineer internship at [Prim'vision](https://www.primvision.com/), a start-up based in Villeneuve-Loubet. I had chosen this internship to improve my mobile and web development skill. For the little story : at first, the considered technology was Java For Mobile, but due to rise of the green robot, my superior decided to go with Android instead. Eclair version, the 2.1, just came out and I was really excited about this open source project: Android.

This experience with Android continued when I had the opportunity to teach at the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis. Since then, I truely enjoy sharing my knowledge about my favourite language with students of [Licence Professionnelle de l'IUT Informatique](http://lpsil.unice.fr/doku.php).

From Froyo (2.2) to Kitkat (4.4) and other patisseries, changes are not a chill out task but always end-up in tasty new experiences.

On a personal note, I'm passionate about sports (running, volleyball, free diving), and that is why the launch of the first connected watch, in June 2014, retained all my attention and fed my [Healthy Heart Rate App](http://www.chillcoding.com/bachamada).
